### Ingredients:

*   1 tablespoon olive oil

*   2 cloves garlic, minced
*   Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, to taste
*   ¼ cup all-purpose flour
*   3 cups vegetable broth
*   1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
*   8 ounces tomato sauce
*   ½ teaspoon dried basil
*   1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
*   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1.  In a large saucepan, melt the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Sauté the diced onion until softened.
2.  Add the minced garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and cook for another minute until fragrant. Stir in the flour and cook for one more minute.
3.  Gradually add the vegetable broth, whisking to combine. Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, and dried basil. Season with salt and pepper to your liking.
4.  Bring the soup to a gentle boil and then add the tortellini. Cook for a few minutes, until the tortellini is tender.
5.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the fresh spinach, Parmesan cheese, and heavy cream.
6.  Serve the soup warm, garnished with fresh chopped basil and extra Parmesan cheese. This soup pairs well with homemade breadsticks.

### Recipe Variations:

*   **Sausage Tortellini Soup:** Brown some ground sausage with the onion for added flavor and protein.
*   **Extra Vegetables:** Feel free to add other vegetables like celery, shredded carrots, baby broccoli, chopped kale, or zucchini while sautéing the onion.
*   **Crockpot Method:** To make this in a slow cooker, first sauté the onion and then transfer it to the crockpot. Add the remaining ingredients except for the tortellini, spinach, Parmesan cheese, and cream. Cook on low for 4-5 hours. Add the tortellini in the last 30 minutes of cooking, and then stir in the spinach, Parmesan, and cream just before serving.
