🧾 Ingredients 🧾
One 12 ounce jar pickled jalapeño slices (I am using Mt. Olive)
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or 1/2 teaspoon for a spicier sauce
1/2 cup mayonnaise (I am using Dukes, of course)
1/2 cup sour cream

👨‍🍳 Instructions 👨‍🍳
1) Add the entire jar of pickled jalapeño slices, including the liquid, to a blender. Blend until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. The mixture should look like a thin, pale green puree with no visible chunks.
2) In a mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and salt. Stir until the mixture is completely smooth and evenly seasoned.
3) Add seven tablespoons of the blended jalapeño puree to the bowl and mix until fully incorporated. Start with seven tablespoons, then taste and add more puree if desired. Adding too much can make the sauce overly vinegary or too spicy, so increase gradually.
4) Transfer the sauce to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least one hour before using. This resting time allows the flavors to fully develop. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to four days.
