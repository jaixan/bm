# Dutch Oven Bread

# Ingredients:  

- 3 cup bread flour  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1 tsp yeast  
- 1 1/2 cup warm water  

# Method:  
- In a large bowl, whisk 3 cups flour, yeast and salt. Stir in water and enough remaining flour to form a moist, shaggy dough. Do not knead. Cover and let rise in a cool place until doubled, 7-8 hours.  
- Preheat oven to 450°; place a Dutch oven with lid on center rack and heat for at least 30 minutes. Once Dutch oven is heated, turn out dough onto a generously floured surface. Using a metal scraper or spatula, quickly shape into a round loaf. Gently place on a piece of parchment.  
- Using a sharp knife, make a 1/4-in.-deep slash across top of loaf. Using the parchment, immediately lower bread into heated Dutch oven. Cover; bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped, 15-20 minutes longer, partially covering if it's browning too much. Remove loaf from pan and cool completely on a wire rack.
