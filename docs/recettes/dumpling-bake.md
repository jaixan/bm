## Instructions  

Instructions
1. In a 9x13-inch baking dish, whisk together coconut milk, chicken broth, red curry paste, peanut butter, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, fish sauce, honey, lime juice, and sesame oil until smooth and well combined.  
2. Add in the spinach and sliced mushrooms so they’re evenly coated in the sauce.  
3. Place the frozen potstickers or gyozas directly into the sauce in a single layer, making sure they don’t overlap. Spoon some of the sauce over the top of the dumplings.  
4. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 27–32 minutes, or until the dumplings are heated through and tender.  
5. Remove the foil in the last 5 minutes to get the dumplings extra crispy on top.  
6. Sprinkle with green onions and sesame seeds, drizzle with chili oil, and serve hot with steamed white rice.
